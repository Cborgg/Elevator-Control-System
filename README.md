# Elevator-Control-System-Using-System-Verilog
     

## Introduction 

Elevators, a cornerstone of modern urban infrastructure, have transformed the way we navigate multi-story  buildings,  offering  unparalleled  convenience  and  access.  Their  operational precision is vital to ensuring efficient vertical transportation while prioritizing passenger safety. 

Our focus lies in the creation of a System Verilog Finite State Machine (FSM) that governs an elevator control system. This system caters to the intricate demands of multi-story buildings, balancing passenger requests and security measures. 

The elevator control system outlined herein adheres to a comprehensive set of requirements. These include accommodating user floor selections, managing passenger priority requests, providing an emergency stop mechanism, employing limit sensors for floor range supervision, orchestrating a well-structured finite state machine, developing a user-friendly interface, and subjecting the system to rigorous testing and simulation. 

## Assumptions Made 

These  assumptions  provide  context  for  understanding  how  the  elevator  control  system functions in various scenarios. Let's break down each assumption: 

### 1. Direction Persistence 

The first assumption, about the elevator not changing direction until it completes all requests in that direction, is crucial for maintaining efficiency in elevator operations. This means that if the elevator is moving upward, it will continue to serve requests going upward until there are no more requests in that direction. The same applies when moving downward. This behavior aligns with the concept of the elevator prioritizing requests in the direction it's currently moving. 

### 2. Idle State 

The assumption that the elevator stops and becomes idle after serving all requests at the latest destination  floor  is  a  practical  one.  It  ensures  that  the  elevator  doesn't  keep  moving unnecessarily once all passenger requests have been fulfilled. The idle state is a crucial part of the system's operation as it signifies that the elevator is available for new requests. 

### 3. Door Control Signal 

The assumption that arrival sensors generate a control signal for opening the lift door for a clock timer upon reaching the destination floor is a standard feature in elevator systems. It ensures that the doors remain open for a sufficient time to allow passengers to enter and exit the elevator  safely. This  safety  feature  is  essential  for preventing  accidents  and  ensuring passenger convenience. 

Collectively, these assumptions provide a clear understanding of the elevator control system's behavior and operation. They set the foundation for defining the system's states, transitions, and  logic,  as  well  as  for  designing  test  scenarios  to  validate  the  system's  performance. Additionally, they align with common practices in elevator control systems, ensuring that the designed system operates efficiently and safely in a multi-story building. 

## Modified Priority Algorithm Implementation and Functionality 

### 1. Priority Algorithm Overview 

The Elevator Control System has been significantly improved through the implementation of a modified priority algorithm. This algorithm introduces key enhancements to request handling, aiming to optimize elevator operations by intelligently prioritizing user requests based on proximity and direction, thereby overcoming the limitations of the traditional First-Come-First- Serve (FCFS) approach. 

### 2. Proximity-Based Prioritization 
#### - Directional Priority 

One of the primary enhancements is the introduction of directional priority. This feature ensures that the elevator considers the direction it's currently moving in and prioritizes requests that align with this direction. Specifically: 

- When the elevator is moving upwards, it gives higher priority to requests for higher floors in the same upward direction. 
- When the elevator is moving downwards, it prioritizes requests for lower floors in the same downward direction. 
#### - Proximity Priority 

Within requests that are in the same direction as the elevator's movement, the algorithm further refines its decision-making process by selecting the request that is closest in terms of floors to the elevator's current position. This approach guarantees that the elevator serves the most relevant request efficiently, reducing unnecessary travel and wait times for passengers. 

### 3. Efficient Movement Planning 
#### - Direction Adjustment 

To  ensure  efficient  response  to  prioritized  requests,  the  elevator  dynamically  adjusts  its movement direction based on the highest-priority request identified by the algorithm. If, for instance,  the  elevator  is  currently  moving  upward  but  a  higher-priority  request  is  in  the downward direction, the elevator will alter its course to serve this priority request optimally. 

#### - Reducing Unnecessary Stops 

By giving precedence to requests that align with the elevator's current direction and minimizing the distance to the next priority request, the modified algorithm significantly diminishes the number  of  unnecessary  stops.  This  not  only  conserves  energy  but  also  leads  to  shorter passenger wait times, enhancing overall efficiency and user satisfaction. 

### 4. Handling Multiple Requests 
#### - Optimized Order 

In scenarios where multiple users request different floors in the same direction, the elevator control system is designed to optimize the order in which these requests are fulfilled. The system prioritizes requests that minimize the distance traveled, ensuring that passengers are picked up and dropped off efficiently, further reducing travel time and energy consumption. 

#### - Energy Efficiency 

This optimized order not only benefits passengers by reducing their time spent in the elevator but also contributes to energy conservation, as fewer stops and less unnecessary travel result in reduced power consumption and environmental impact. 

### 5. Emergency System Integration 
#### - Emergency Stop 

In the interest of passenger safety, the elevator system incorporates an emergency system that allows passengers to activate an emergency stop button when necessary. When this button is activated, the elevator comes to a controlled halt, saving the current direction and status. This ensures a safe response to emergencies. 

#### - Resumption After Emergency 

Following the resolution of the emergency and the rest of the emergency stop button, the elevator  seamlessly  resumes  its  normal  operation.  It  automatically  reverts  to  the  saved direction, ensuring that the safety features of the emergency system are integrated with the efficiency  of  the  modified  priority  algorithm, maintaining  both  passenger  well-being  and operational efficiency. 

In summary, the implementation of the modified priority algorithm within the Elevator Control System  represents  a  substantial  improvement  in  elevator  operations.  By  intelligently prioritizing  requests  based  on  proximity  and  direction,  the  system  reduces  travel  times, conserves energy, and enhances the overall passenger experience. The seamless integration of an emergency system ensures that safety is not compromised while maximizing efficiency in elevator operations. 

## Optimization and Achievement: Scalable Elevator Control System

This achievement is a testament to the system's versatility and scalability, which are essential attributes for addressing diverse building configurations and future needs. 

### 1. Adaptive Scalability 

The elevator Control System is not confined to a specific number of floors. It can be efficiently scaled down to accommodate as few as 2 floors or scaled up to handle potentially hundreds of floors, such as 64 floors, with minimal changes to the code and no changes core state table and diagram. 

### 2. Unified State Table and Diagram 

What sets our system apart is its unified state table and diagram. Regardless of the number of floors, the fundamental logic and structure of the state transitions remain consistent. This unified  approach  simplifies  development,  maintenance,  and  understanding,  ensuring  that modifications for different floor counts are straightforward. 

### 3. Resource Efficiency 

Our design prioritizes resource efficiency. It strikes a balance between flexibility and resource consumption, ensuring that the system remains responsive and resource-friendly even when scaling to handle a wide range of floor counts. 


### 4. Code Maintainability 

Achieving scalability without compromising code readability and maintainability is a key success factor. The codebase is well-structured and organized, making it easy to adapt to varying floor counts while preserving its clarity and ease of maintenance. 

### 5. Thorough Testing and Validation 

Rigorous  testing  and  validation  have  been  conducted,  primarily  focusing  on  the  8-floor configuration. This  extensive testing  demonstrates  the  system's  reliability  and  robustness, laying a solid foundation for scalability testing in the future. 

### 6. Universal Applicability 

The adaptability of our Elevator Control System to different floor counts makes it a universal solution. Architects, building planners, and developers can confidently apply this system to a wide range of building structures, ensuring that it meets their specific requirements. 

### 7. Future-Ready Design 

By optimizing our system to handle 8 floors while ensuring scalability, we are future-proofing the technology. This forward-looking approach anticipates the evolving demands of the vertical transportation industry, where building sizes and complexities continue to evolve. 

In conclusion, our Elevator Control System's optimization and achievement of adaptability to varying  floor  counts  showcase  its  versatility,  scalability,  and  resource  efficiency.  This accomplishment positions our system as a versatile and future-ready solution, ready to meet the diverse needs of the vertical transportation industry, from small-scale buildings to high- rises with numerous floors.

## State Diagrams 

In addition to the implementation of the elevator control system in System Verilog, we have created comprehensive state diagrams to visualize the system's finite state machine. These state diagrams  were generated  using  the Python  library pydot, providing  a  clear and  intuitive  representation of the elevator's operational states and transitions.

## Design.sv Explanation 

### 1. Module Declaration 
   - The code defines a Verilog module named "Lift8" with various input and output signals. 
#### - Inputs 
  - clk: A clock signal for synchronous operation. 
  - reset: A reset signal used to initialize the elevator system. 
  - req\_floor : A 3-bit input representing the requested floors (0 to 7). 
  - emergency\_stop : An input signal that serves as an emergency stop button. 
#### - Outputs 
  - door: A 2-bit output representing the state of the elevator door. 
  - max\_request: A 3-bit output representing the highest requested floor. 
  - min\_request: A 3-bit output representing the lowest requested floor. 
  - Up: A 2-bit output indicating whether the elevator is moving up. 
  - Down: A 2-bit output indicating whether the elevator is moving down. 
  - idle: A 2-bit output indicating whether the elevator is idle. 
  - current\_floor: A 3-bit output representing the current floor of the elevator. 
  - requests : An 8-bit output representing the floor requests. 
### 2. Internal Variables 
- door\_timer: A signal used to control the timing of elevator door opening and closing. 
- emergency\_stopped:  A  signal  to  indicate  whether  the  elevator  is  in  an emergency stop state. 
- flag: A flag to manage emergency stop state transitions. 
- updownflag : A flag used during emergency reset to keep track of the previous values of "Up" and "Down" directions. 


### 3. Request Handling 
- An always block updates the elevator's request list (requests) based on the requested floors (req\_floor). 
- It  also  updates  max\_request  (Highest  Floor  no.  in  requests  queue)  and min\_request  (Lowest Floor no. in requests queue)  based on the requested floors and the current floor.  
### 4. Current Floor Handling 
- Another  always  block  handles  the  elevator's  behavior  when  it  reaches  a requested floor. 
- If the elevator arrives at a requested floor, it sets the elevator to idle, opens the door, clears the request, and starts a door timer. 
### 5. State Machine for Lift Control 
- The core logic of the elevator control system is implemented within an always @(posedge clk) block, representing a synchronous state machine. 
- It handles various states and transitions: 
  - Reset: Initializes elevator state. 
  - Emergency Stop: Activated when the emergency stop button is pressed. 
  - Emergency Stop (During Stopped State): Remains stopped until the emergency stop button is released. 
  - Emergency Reset: Clears the emergency stop state when the button is released. 
  - Normal  Operation:  Handles  normal  elevator  movement  based  on requests and current floor. 
  - Opening Door: Opens the door when the elevator arrives at a requested floor. 
  - Other Cases: Handles cases for moving up, moving down, and staying idle based on the requested floors. 
 

### 6. Usage of min\_request and max\_request
- min\_request keeps track of the lowest floor number that has pending requests, while max\_request tracks the highest floor number with pending requests. 
- These variables are used to optimize the elevator's movement strategy: 
  - If the elevator is moving upward and reaches max\_request, it changes direction to move downward to serve lower floors efficiently. 
  - Similarly, if the elevator is moving downward and reaches min\_request, it changes direction to move upward to serve higher floors efficiently. 
- min\_request and max\_request ensure that the elevator prioritizes requests based on their relative positions, minimizing unnecessary travel and wait times. 

In summary, this Verilog module represents an elevator control system that manages floor requests, handles emergencies and controls the elevator's movement and door operation. The code uses a state machine to control the elevator's behavior under different conditions and states.
